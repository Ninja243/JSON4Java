# JSON4Java
My implementation of methods handling JSON data in Java. The parser and lexer used here were appropriated and translated from Eaton Phil's awesome pj library found at https://github.com/eatonphil/pj/blob/master/pj/lexer.py. Pull requests fixing anything are always appreciated, as is testing and the reporting of issues. __This library is not bug free by any means yet. If you don't want to spend time dealing with some downright weird bugs, you might want to find another solution to your problem.__

## Usage
Grab a JAR from the release page or clone this project and insert it into
your project. To make a JSON object that contains your information, 
create a new instance of the JSONObject class like this:

```java
JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
```
### Adding information
```java
json.addRule("name", "Mweya");
json.addRule("age", 20);
json.addRule("bored", true);
```
This even works for arrays!
```java
int[] ages = {12, 23, 55};
json.addRule("ages", ages);
```
Documents and arrays of rules can be added in a similar fashion:
```java
JSONObject location = newJSONObject();
location.addRule("lat", 31.445363);
location.addRule("long", 23.343567);
json.addRule("location", location);
```
### Searching for rules
```java
JSONRule rule = json.searchSelector("name");
```
### Deleting rules
```java
json.deleteRule("name");
json.removeRule("location");
```
Rules at a certain index can be deleted in a similar fashion:
```java
json.deleteRule(2);
```
### Writing to a file
```java
json.toFile("file.json");
```
### Reading from a file
#### âš  Warning:
This feature is currently _very_ buggy and should probably not be used yet. As always, pull requests would be appreciated!
```java
json.fromFile("path/to/file.json");
```
If you need to save a JSONObject, try using [serialization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_serialization.htm) for now.
